===========================
Cinder-Syphon - An implementation of the Syphon framework for Cinder
===========================

Anatomy:

example-Basic - contains a simple Syphon example
example-SyphonServerDirectory - a server directory example
lib - the framework and namebound client
src - the Cinder implementation

Objects:

Syphon Client - Receive frames from a Syphon server
Syphon Server - Publish frames to Syphon
Syphon Server Directory - Browse available Syphon servers

Requires Mac OS X 10.7+ and Cinder 0.8.5

To add Syphon to your project:

 - Drag the Cinder-Syphon blocks folder into your project (like any other Cinder block)
 - Add a Copy Files build phase to new projects to copy the Syphon framework (in the /lib folder) into the Frameworks folder of the built product.

The included examples demonstrate these steps.

Use any Syphon-enabled application to send or receive frames. You can use the [Syphon Demo Apps](http://code.google.com/p/syphon-implementations/downloads/detail?name=Syphon%20Demo%20Apps%20Public%20Beta%202.dmg) to test functionality.
